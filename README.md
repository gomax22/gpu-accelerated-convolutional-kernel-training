# GPU-Accelerated Convolutional Kernel Training for Vertical Edge Detection
## Abstract
Convolutional layers are a key component of several deep learning models, such
as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been particularly successful
in image and video processing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.
In this report, we focus on a simplified task, such as vertical edge detection,
for training a convolutional kernel on a synthetic dataset of labeled images,
in which the convolution is performed on a GPU architecture, according to a
proper parallelization strategy.

The report will cover several theoretical and implementative aspect of the solution.
* Problem definition and analysis
* Input and Output
* Algorithm description
* Implemented routines
* Performance analysis
* Usage examples
